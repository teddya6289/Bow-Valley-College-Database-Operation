**The assessment is to focus on Microsoft SQL server, you can find attached the Python file with Python methods that creates a connection to Microsoft SQL server 
automatically once the code runs and also another method that acts like the Microsoft server management studio to write and read SQL statement to the database
dynamically interacting and prompting the user to write his or her SQL statement.Why is the Project a game changer?**  

**It is a game changer, because the Python programs written for this project is dynamic and interactive, it communicates with user and also allow the opportunity to 
write SQL statement as if it were a database tool like the SSMS/SQL developer.Another reason This program was designed to access too database which are MSSQL Sever and Oracle. 
How does it do this? It does it by first asking the user to choose which of the database he or she wants to access, and there after it proceed to creating a connection for the 
respective database and open up an SQL statement prompt for the user to work with. This is important because it saves the user resources and time of having to install the database 
tool for both MSSQL Sever and Oracle (SSMS, SQL developer), with this program the user can utilize both functionalities seamlessly.**
Please find attached the Python file.
